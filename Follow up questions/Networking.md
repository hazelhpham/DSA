* There was an engineering manager , he asked some introductory questions , such as your experience and why Bloomberg?


* Then he started with question where he drew a diagram , related to a realtime feature of bloomberg Terminal , where data is being fetched from exchange and processed by backend and then sent to receivers.


* Talked about Pub/Sub.
Asked the characteristics the server should have, such as data accuracy, availabitility, consistency, low latency.


* Then the interview became focused on Latency , where he gave me question to build up an internal latency logger , so that if something goes wrong , the developer should get alerts.
