# Tell me about X in your resume. What did you use as the DB and why? What inspired you to build this?
# Why X university? What are some of the courses you enjoyed?
# What are you looking for? Why do you think Bloomberg would be a good fit for that?


# If you have any personal projects or internship experience listed on your resume, make sure you can talk extensively about it. I find that if you can really engage with the interviewer on this part you'll be able to get out of them trying to fill the remainding time with more Leetcode problems. I've seen some people get 3-4 leetcode problems with one interviewer which is just insane to me. I would first talk about the motivation behind why this project was created in the first place. If it's something you worked on at an internship, you should be able to contact some more senior folks on your team who can explain this elagantly if you're having trouble coming up with this part. After explaining the motivation, go into how the application itself works. Try to be as detailed as possbile going through the pipeline of all its functionality along with the tools and technology used. Being able to explain what library you used and why you used it will show the interviewer you actually understand how pieces of the system work together. The last and probably the most important part is explaining your contribution to the project. What did you do? Why was it important for this piece you worked on to exist? What challenges did you face coming up with the solution? Why did you use this library/language in particular? Do you think there was a better way to do this? These are all questions that came up 
# in some form or another so make sure you start thinking about these things as you're preparing.
