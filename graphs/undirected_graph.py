CYCLE DETECTION
Given an undirected graph. The task is to check if there is a cycle
in a given graph. 
Input: V = 4, E = 4
Output: Yes 


1. using BFS:
- a visit set
- a queue 

basically just go thru each node like usual
then once we see them in the visit set -> we return False

2. using DFS
- if we encounter a visited vertex again, then we say, there is
a cycle
- we keep track of parent node [(node, and par) in Graph Valid Tree] 
in the DFS traversal and ignore the parent node from visited condition. 


Key Idea:
In an undirected graph, when traversing the graph (via DFS), every edge is bidirectional. This means:

If we visit a node u and traverse to its neighbor v, we must account for the fact that the edge (v, u) (back to the parent) will also be encountered during the traversal.
This back edge to the parent is not a cycle; itâ€™s simply revisiting the previous node in the traversal.
To distinguish a true cycle from this backtracking behavior, we skip the parent node during the cycle check.
