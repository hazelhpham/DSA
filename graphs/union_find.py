- Two sets are called disjoint sets if they dont have
any element in common, the intersection of sets is a 
NULL set

- A data structure that are stores non overlapping or disjoint subset of elements is called disjoint data structure. 
- Disjoint data structure supports following operations:
1. adding new sets to the disjoint sets
2. merging disjoint sets to a single disjoint set using **Union**
3. finding representative of a disjoint set using **Find** operation
4. check if 2 sets are disjoint or not
