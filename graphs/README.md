1. Graphs definition
- A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. 
- The vertices = nodes 
- The edges = lines / arcs that connect 2 nodes together

2. Representation of Graph:
- Here are 2 most common ways. (We consider only unweighted graphs in this post):

        2.1. Adjacency Matrix
        - An adjacency Matrix is a way of representing a graph as a matrix of boolean (0's or 1's) 
        2.2. Adjacency List
