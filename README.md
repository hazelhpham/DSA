* Database of questions I collected from Glassdoor, Leetcode discussion, CTCI.
* This repo is specifically for Bloomberg New Grad SWE Interview.
# Things I want to highlight for myself (or anyone going through the process):

- Go through Bloomberg tagged questions
- Ask your interviewer how many questions you’re going to be asked -> will help you manage your time accordingly
- Even though the questions might be similar to what you’ve seen on LC be prepared to struggle with the follow-up questions
- While practicing leetcode make sure you try to stretch your comfort level by exploring different ways to get to an optimal solution

-----> actually read and understand materials + understand the editoral + always strive for the most optimal way, time and space wise! 
- Overcommunicate rather than undercommunicate 


*From the interview process, I clearly realized that the leetcode questions made only half of the process. The interviewers asked many questions related to specific concepts like C++, networking, OS. I had read few books on these topics, so I managed to answer about 70% of the questions. I also clearly stated the things I didn't know about. For them I tried to come up with an answer on the fly while explaining my reasoning to the interviewer.*

*My general advice would be to balance your interview preparation schedule by reading some articles / books / video on subjects you don't know about, at least you'll have a mild understanding and the interviewer will score it as 50%. Of course, you have to ace leetcode, no questions asked, but it is only a necessary condition, not sufficient one (at least for my Bloomberg interviews).*
