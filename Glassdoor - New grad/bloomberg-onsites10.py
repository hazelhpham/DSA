# Q1:
# The next round was at their Princeton office a month later. Had two technical interviews. 
# The first interviewer asked questions on Data Structures. Like complexities of various operations(insert, search, delete) on data structures like array, 
# linked list, heap, stack, trees. Then questions on networking and operating systems. I had taken OS class more than an year back and didn't take any Computer network classes during my grad studies(the interviewer was surprised on this). 
# Too bad not to revise them and messed up on these questions. Then a simple problem of opening and close bracket validation which I solved but didn't engineer well. 
# The next round was about concepts of OOP, language design and garbage collection. I think my first round had already made a bad dent and the second round was over earlier than the interview of other candidates with me.
# After lunch, it was a small discussion of 5-10 min with the HR person with questions like what interests you in Bloomberg etc.


#Q2: How hashtables work? Validate the opening and closing of brackets in a string. 
# What interest you to work at Bloomberg?

#Q3: Definitely use Cracking the Coding Interview for this one, some of the questions were straight out of the book. 
# Q1: Perform and print level order traversal of a binary tree Q2: Add 2 numbers whose digits are stored in a linked list, i.e. add(1->2->3->4, 4->5->6->7) is equivalent to adding 1234 + 4567. 
# Q3: Print level at which node is in a binary tree 
# Q4: Iterative Fibonacci

# 1. In a big file of two very very long strings, delete the characters which they both have. 
# 2. disjoint set questions
