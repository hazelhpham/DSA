"""
study tagged past 3 months thatâ€™s what got me my full correctness on the onsite

i think what went wrong was some minor problems writing some of the code like trying to add a graph node to 
my visited set just before checking whether my node was visited lol
 (idk why it caused a rejection cuz i fixed it without the interviewer needing to tell me)

#Question 50: design a subway class that has a method to get the average passing time between 
# 2 stations in a time complexity O(1)


class Subway:

        total_time = self.times[start][end]

# Example Usage:
subway = Subway()
subway.add_trip("StationA", "StationB", 10)
subway.add_trip("StationA", "StationB", 20)
subway.add_trip("StationA", "StationC", 15)

# Get average time between StationA and StationB
print(subway.get_average_time("StationA", "StationB"))  # Output: 15.0

# Get average time between StationA and StationC
print(subway.get_average_time("StationA", "StationC"))  # Output: 15.0

# Get average time between StationB and StationC (no trips)
print(subway.get_average_time("StationB", "StationC"))  # Output: 0.0
