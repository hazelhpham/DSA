and later a tree problem where you would simply use BFT or DFT with a counter. Next they schedule a «virtual onsite». One coding interview, again easy problem with maximum simultaneous meeting to count needed meeting rooms. First I had a wrong idea, implemented it. And later the interviewer pointed out an example where my code would be incorrect. I quickly fixed it and we talked a bit more about testing etc. This, together with the phone screen, were some really nice people I would say. Next the same day I had a system design interview. I needed to design an alerts system that notifies users about stock price change. Taking into account that there are a lot of alerts. Honestly comparing to their coding questions this one wasn’t asked right. No text to refer to, no nothing. I was told to “not think about load” and to “draw an overview", but then the interviewers would delve into details before I was finished. On this interview I felt the strongest communication barrier
