#1) Identify the parent child relationship among the following rows. Parent row: any row which can be represented by summation of the consecutive rows following it. (If the consecutive row is a Parent then it's children may be collapsed/skipped during summation. 
# 2) Question 1: Given 4 random generated numbers from 1-10, write a program to decide whether it is viable to use operations (limited in +, -, *, and /) on each and every number exactly once to generate result 24.

Answer question
"""


"""
Applied through online and got a call from recruiter. Got scheduled for a first round interviewer. Felt like interviewer was not well prepared. When I was asking more clarity on the question, he was like "don't complicate the things. " He initially asked me my approach and said my approach. He said about its time complexity and asked if I can enhance it. Time complexity needs to be done in air and we need enhance it by thinking in the air. Somehow started the coding, he was continuously questioning my approach without even completing my code completely. Not sure how he was expecting a optimal solution without brute-force approach. After the interview I felt like to think twice if offered this position.

Interview questions [1]

Question 1

File entries, of service and their start/stop times. Return the top k services that has most execution time stamp. Since he mentioned file, I was not sure whether we need to read from the file or how do the program gets input, "don' t complicate the things" was the reply I got.
