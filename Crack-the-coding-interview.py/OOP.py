#Q2:
"""
FizzBuzz: In the classic problem FizzBuzz, you are told to print the numbers from 1 to n. 
However, when the number is divisible by 3, print"Fizz''. When it is divisible by 5, print"Buzz''. 
When it is divis­ ible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz''. In this problem, you are asked to do this in a multithreaded way. Implement a multithreaded version of FizzBuzz with four threads.
One thread checks for divisibility of 3 and prints "Fizz''. Another thread is responsible for divisibility of 5 and prints"Buzz''. A third thread is responsible for divisibility of 3 and 5 and prints"FizzBuzz''. 
A fourth thread does the numbers.
