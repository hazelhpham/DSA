#Q1:
# I joined in the Hackerrank code editor, turned on my video. Interviewer turned 5 minutes late and called me on my cell later. Interview started 10 minutes late.
# He did not introduce himself and straight up jumped to my resume. I could not see the interviewer as he did not turn on his video.
# After telling him about one of my projects, he copy-pasted the interview question.


# Question was to delete a node from BST, given the key and return the updated key in its place. He used the term 'root' in the question which was not the correct term.

# Anyway, he was not expecting compiled code - asked me to draw up the solution and he wants to see my logic behind.

# I had seen the question that morning itself so I was pretty confident in answering it.


# I walked through the various cases and wrote the code for it, was stuck at a point. Solved it after he gave me a hint. In the end he asked me for the time complexity of the code.

Interviewing for senior software engineer, recruiter reached out on linkedin.


This was the first technical round with hackrrank coding questions, 1 hour. The problem was pretty complex and haven't seen this in leetcode tagged with bloomberg. Not sure if this even exists on leetcode.


The question was to find longest matching word from dictionary for given set of chars.
e.g.
dict={when, what, whatthen, whatnow}, input="whatno", expected output= "what"
dict={when, what, whatthen, whatnow}, input="whatnwo", expected output= "whatnow"
dict={when, what, whatthen, whatnow}, input="wonthaw", expected output= "whatnow"

There are students registered for courses. We need to group students based on common courses.
s1 is student1 and c1 is course1 and so on.
Example Input:
s1: c1, c2,c3
s2: c4,c2,c5
s3: c6,c7
s4: c1,c8
s5: c7,c9
s6: c10


Output : [[s1,s2,s4],[s3,s5],[s6]]

Coding 1: First non-repeating character in a string (easy but the interviewer kept on adding special test cases)
https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/
(But, return type is the char, also some extra cases like string has numbers, special chars, upper and lower alphabets. He told me to not consider numbers and special characters for the process and then expected to return the character itself, so A and a are different characters for returning but same while counting the frequency.
