#Q1: 
#   System Design (1 hour):
#   	Some version of the top-k stock trades by Volume and Value.
#   	Discussed several algorithmic approaches
#   	Deployment discussion.
#   	Functional requirements: Api end points, return types, user types
#   	Non Functional requirements: Real time? Latency, expected throughput, traffic, etc

#Q2:
#   Design a system that gets packets out of order and how will you handle it.
#   Design 3 methods for a system. The first method enables us to add new customers to the end of the queue (waiting line). The second method enables us to place the first customer in the queue, to an available table. The 3rd method allows us to let a customer in the queue to move forward by 1 position when thhey pay $1. 
# The time complexity for each method was supposed to be O(1).
