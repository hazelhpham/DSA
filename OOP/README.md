Bloomberg is a huge fan of Object Oriented Programming questions.
That is why I want to dedicate a great deal of my time to learn very thoroughly about core concepts of OOP. 

I gather questions from glassdoor.com, leetcode.com/discussion, and finally: Crack the coding interview. 

I used to interview for Microsoft and I got a OOD question that is 100% exactly with a question in CTCI. 
All the OOP questions from CTCI are easy - medium level and I'd say it is fairly easy to sit down, collaborate with interviewer and come up with solution while chatting about some other concepts in OOP (inheritance, polymorphism, etc).
